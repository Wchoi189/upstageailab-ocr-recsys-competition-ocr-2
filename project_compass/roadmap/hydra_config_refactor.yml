objectives:
  - name: Reduce Configuration Files
    description: Reduce 123 config files by 35-50%
    success_criteria:
      - "Final count: 60-80 config files"
      - "All configs have @package directives"

  - name: Enforce Domain Isolation
    description: Strict separation of detection/recognition/kie domains
    success_criteria:
      - "No domain leakage in configs"
      - "Domain controllers with explicit nullification"

  - name: Centralize Path Interpolations
    description: All dynamic paths in configs/global/paths.yaml
    success_criteria:
      - "Zero hardcoded paths in domain configs"
      - "Single source of truth for all paths"

  - name: Eliminate Legacy and UI Bloat
    description: Remove obsolete and UI-specific configurations
    success_criteria:
      - "All legacy configs moved to archive/__LEGACY__/"
      - "All UI configs moved to archive/ui_configs/"

phases:
  - name: "Phase 1: Preparation"
    status: pending
    steps:
      - "Run baseline audit with 02_SCRIPT_migration_auditor.py"
      - "Create backup of configs/ directory"
      - "Create archive directories for legacy/UI files"

  - name: "Phase 2: Structural Migration"
    status: pending
    steps:
      - "Establish global layer (configs/global/paths.yaml)"
      - "Move legacy files to archive/__LEGACY__/"
      - "Relocate UI configs to archive/ui_configs/"
      - "Create domain controllers with proper isolation"

  - name: "Phase 3: Validation"
    status: pending
    steps:
      - "Run migration auditor to verify improvements"
      - "Run Hydra Guard for runtime validation"
      - "Test training runs for all domains"
