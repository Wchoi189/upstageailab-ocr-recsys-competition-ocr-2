# Analysis Result

**Mode:** enhancement_validation
**Backend:** dashscope
**Processing Time:** 29.81s

## Analysis

```markdown
# Enhancement Validation Report

**Image**: receipt_comparison.jpg
**Enhancement**: Background normalization, contrast boost, shadow reduction, slight deskewing
**Verdict**: Moderate

## Summary
- Key Wins: Reduced yellow tint, improved text-background contrast, minor shadow suppression, slightly better alignment.
- Key Issues: No significant noise reduction; background still not neutral white; some text edges appear slightly over-sharpened.
- Recommendation: Tune — enhance contrast and white balance further for OCR readiness.

## Metrics

| Dimension | Before | After | Δ | Success |
|-----------|--------|-------|---|---------|
| Tint Severity | 8 | 5 | -3 | ⚠️ |
| Slant Angle | ±1.5° | ±0.8° | -0.7° | ✅ |
| Contrast | 5 | 7 | +2 | ✅ |
| Shadows | 6 | 4 | -2 | ✅ |
| Noise | 4 | 4 | 0 | ⚠️ |
| Overall | 5 | 7 | +2 | ✅ |

## Detailed Observations

### 1. Background Improvement
- Color normalization: [Before RGB ~190,160,100] → [After RGB ~220,210,180] — warmer yellow tint reduced but not fully corrected to neutral white.
- Tint severity (1-10): Before [8] → After [5] — noticeable improvement, but residual warmth remains.
- Uniformity (1-10): Before [6] → After [7] — background more consistent, though faint texture still visible.
- Success: Achieved neutral white? No — the paper still has a warm off-white tone, likely due to incomplete white balancing.

### 2. Text Alignment
- Slant angle: Before [±1.5°] → After [±0.8°] — slight correction applied, bringing receipt closer to horizontal.
- Alignment quality (1-10): Before [7] → After [8] — visually straighter, no perceptible tilt affecting readability.
- Success: Horizontal within ±2°? Yes — final slant is well within acceptable tolerance for OCR processing.

### 3. Contrast Enhancement
- Text-background contrast (1-10): Before [5] → After [7] — black text now stands out significantly against lighter background.
- Faded text recovery: Yes — faint lines and small Korean characters (e.g., refund policy) are more legible.
- Success: Contrast ≥7 for OCR? Yes — sufficient for most modern OCR engines, though edge cases may still require tuning.

### 4. Shadow/Illumination
- Shadow severity (1-10): Before [6] → After [4] — shadows along left/right edges softened.
- Illumination uniformity (1-10): Before [6] → After [7] — lighting appears more even across receipt width.
- Success: Shadows reduced? Yes — gradient artifacts minimized, improving overall visual consistency.

### 5. Noise/Artifacts
- Noise level (1-10): Before [4] → After [4] — no measurable noise reduction; graininess unchanged.
- New artifacts: Slight haloing around high-contrast text edges; possible over-sharpening in barcode area.
- Success: Noise reduced without quality loss? No — noise unchanged, and minor sharpening artifacts introduced.

### 6. Overall Quality
- Quality score (1-10): Before [5] → After [7] — clear visual upgrade in clarity and readability.
- Readability (1-10): Before [6] → After [8] — all critical fields (items, prices, dates) now easily discernible.
- Processing necessary: Was preprocessing justified? Yes — enhancements make this receipt significantly more suitable for digital archiving or OCR extraction.
