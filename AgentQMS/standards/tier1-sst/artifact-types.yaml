# Artifact Type Standards & Reference
#
# This file serves as a REFERENCE and INDEX to artifact types.
# The SOURCE OF TRUTH for artifact type definitions is the plugin system:
#   - Plugin Definitions: AgentQMS/.agentqms/plugins/artifact_types/*.yaml
#   - Validation Rules: .agentqms/schemas/artifact_type_validation.yaml
#   - Validator: AgentQMS/tools/core/plugins/validation.py
#
# This YAML provides high-level overview and validation command references.

  source_of_truth: "Plugin System (AgentQMS/.agentqms/plugins/artifact_types/)"
  validation_schema: ".agentqms/schemas/artifact_type_validation.yaml"
  validation_command: "cd AgentQMS/bin && make validate"

  description: |
    Artifact types are defined as plugins to enable extensibility without code changes.
    Each artifact type plugin specifies:
    - Metadata (filename pattern, directory, frontmatter schema)
    - Template content with variables
    - Validation rules (required sections, fields, statuses)

    The PluginValidator enforces centralized rules from artifact_type_validation.yaml,
    ensuring naming consistency, prohibited type blocking, and standards compliance.

  # The actual source is the plugin system.
