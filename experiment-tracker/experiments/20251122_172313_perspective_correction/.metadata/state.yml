current_state: ACTIVE
experiment_goal: Evaluate and improve perspective correction algorithms on rembg-processed images
initial_assessment: Import and organize existing perspective correction and rembg optimization experiments
current_phase: Rembg Mask-Based Approach Development & Testing
success_rate: 73% (146/200 images) baseline, 44% on worst performers with rembg mask approach
improvement_status: Rembg mask-based approach implemented, edge-based line fitting in development
key_achievements:
  - Comprehensive 200-image test completed (73% success rate baseline)
  - Pre-correction validation implemented (catches 52% of failures early)
  - Corner detection improved (min_area_ratio increased to 0.3)
  - Rembg mask-based approach implemented (50% success on random failures, 44% on worst 50)
  - Multi-point edge detection and line fitting approach developed
  - Process documentation with mermaid diagrams created
  - Worst performers analysis completed (50 cases identified and tested)
  - All experiment artifacts organized in experiment-tracker
next_steps:
  - Refine edge-based line fitting algorithm (currently underperforming)
  - Test improved edge approach on larger dataset
  - Optimize RANSAC parameters and edge grouping logic
  - Integrate best approach into main production pipeline
  - Monitor production performance and track success rates
known_issues:
  - 27% failure rate (54/200) with cv2-based approach
  - Rembg mask approach: 44% success on worst performers (needs improvement)
  - Edge-based line fitting: Currently performing worse than 4-point approach (needs tuning)
  - Post-correction area loss: 24 cases lose 40-50% area despite passing pre-validation
  - Complex layouts and heavily distorted images remain challenging
