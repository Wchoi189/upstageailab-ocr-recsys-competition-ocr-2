description: "Roadmap for MCP tool performance improvements, telemetry, and VS Code dashboard."

roadmap:
  phase_1:
    name: "Assessment & Research"
    status: "completed"
    goals:
      - "[x] Analyze unified_server.py tool aggregation."
      - "[x] Identify meta-tool duplication issue."
      - "[x] Document visibility gaps in middleware/routing."
      - "[x] Create diagnostic protocol for independent checks."
      - "[x] Propose VS Code extension architecture."

  phase_2:
    name: "Tool Consolidation"
    status: "completed"
    goals:
      - "[x] Remove individual ADT tools from exposure (keep only adt_meta_query, adt_meta_edit)."
      - "[x] Update tools.yaml to include only meta-tools."
      - "[x] Verify routing still works for all 15 query/edit kinds."
      - "[ ] Update agent documentation for new tool semantics."

  phase_3:
    name: "Telemetry Infrastructure"
    status: "completed"
    goals:
      - "[x] Add .mcp-telemetry.jsonl structured logging to unified_server.py."
      - "[x] Track: tool_name, duration_ms, status, policy_violations."
      - "[x] Expose telemetry as MCP resource (mcp://telemetry/recent)."
      - "[x] Add logging to middleware interceptors."
      - "[x] Track context bundle suggestions and loads."

  phase_4:
    name: "VS Code Extension Dashboard"
    status: "completed"
    goals:
      - "[x] Scaffold VS Code extension project."
      - "[x] Implement telemetry file watcher (.mcp-telemetry.jsonl)."
      - "[x] Create dashboard webview with tool/middleware stats."
      - "[x] Add real-time log tailing and policy violation alerts."
      - "[x] Implement context bundle browser."
