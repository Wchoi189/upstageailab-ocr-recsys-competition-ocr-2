# Walkthrough - AgentQMS Pruning Complete

**Date**: 2026-01-03
**Status**: Completed

---

## 🚀 Changes Executed

We have successfully pruned the `AgentQMS` directory to remove bloat while preserving the core functionality required for your Agentic workflows.

### 📂 Directory Updates
1.  **Archived Tools**:
    *   Moved `AgentQMS/tools/ocr` -> `AgentQMS/archive/tools/ocr`
    *   Moved `AgentQMS/tools/maintenance` -> `AgentQMS/archive/tools/maintenance`
2.  **Cleaned Utilities**:
    *   Moved unused scripts (`legacy_migrator.py`, `migrate_vlm_reports.py`, etc.) to `AgentQMS/archive/tools/utilities`.
3.  **Restored Core Config**:
    *   Restored `AgentQMS/.agentqms/settings.yaml` (it was accidentally archived). This file is **critical** for the system to function.

### ✅ Verification Results

We verified the system's health by running the internal CLI tools.

**1. Core Import Check**
```bash
uv run python -c "from AgentQMS.tools.core.artifact_workflow import ArtifactWorkflow; print('✅ ArtifactWorkflow imported successfully')"
# Output: ✅ ArtifactWorkflow imported successfully
```

**2. Template Listing Check**
```bash
uv run python AgentQMS/tools/core/artifact_workflow.py list-templates
# Output:
# Available artifact templates:
#   - implementation_plan
#   - assessment
#   - design...
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

*   **Do NOT archive `AgentQMS/.agentqms`**: This directory contains the runtime configuration (`settings.yaml`) and state (`plugins.yaml`).
*   **Do NOT archive `AgentQMS/standards`**: This is the "Brain" of the QMS.
*   **Do NOT archive `AgentQMS/bin`**: These are your interface scripts.

The system is now leaner ("battle tested") and ready for use.
