# Phase 3 Complete: Streamlit Batch Prediction Alignment

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Branch:** 11_refactor/preprocessing
**Status:** ✅ **ALL PHASES COMPLETE** - Ready for production use

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Phase 3 is COMPLETE!** The Streamlit Batch Prediction feature now has:
- ✅ Correct competition CSV format (`filename,polygons[,confidence]`)
- ✅ Optional confidence scores (average of all detections per image)
- ✅ Coordinate system already aligned with predict.py
- ✅ Preprocessing integration working (better than single-image mode!)
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests (8/8 passing)

**Key Finding:** The coordinate systems were **already aligned** - both workflows use the same `remap_polygons()` function from `ocr.utils.orientation`.

---

## ✅ Completed Work (Phase 3)

### 1. **Fixed Output Format to Match Competition Requirements**

#### Before (INCORRECT):
```csv
image_name,polygons
image001.jpg,10,50,100,50,100,150,10,150
```

#### After (CORRECT):
```csv
filename,polygons
image001.jpg,10,50,100,50,100,150,10,150
```

**Changes Made:**
- submission_writer.py:37 - Changed `image_name` → `filename` in SubmissionEntry model
- submission_writer.py:170 - Updated CSV header to use `filename`
- All existing output was using wrong column name!

### 2. **Added Optional Confidence Score Support**

#### CSV Format with Confidence:
```csv
filename,polygons,confidence
image001.jpg,10,50,100,50,100,150,10,150,0.91
image002.jpg,20,60,120,60,120,160,20,160,0.92
```

**Implementation:**
- submission_writer.py:46 - Added `include_confidence` field to `BatchOutputConfig`
- submission_writer.py:63 - Added confidence parameter to `write_json()`
- submission_writer.py:118 - Added confidence parameter to `write_csv()`
- submission_writer.py:83-85 - Calculates average confidence from all detections
- sidebar.py:154-159 - Added UI checkbox for confidence option

**Confidence Calculation:**
- Takes average of all `confidences` list in `Predictions`
- Only included for successful predictions
- Empty string for failed predictions

### 3. **Coordinate System Validation**

**Key Discovery:** Coordinates are **already aligned!** Both workflows use:
- engine.py:13 imports `remap_polygons` from `ocr.utils.orientation`
- engine.py:221-263 applies `_remap_predictions_if_needed()`
- orientation.py:129-145 defines the canonical transformation

**No changes needed** - the coordinate transformation logic is shared between:
1. Streamlit inference (`ui/utils/inference/engine.py`)
2. Training/predict.py pipeline (`ocr/utils/orientation.py`)

### 4. **Comprehensive Unit Tests**

Created test_submission_writer.py with 8 tests:

```bash
✅ test_submission_entry_model - Pydantic model validation
✅ test_submission_entry_to_dict - Dictionary conversion
✅ test_write_csv_format - Basic CSV output format
✅ test_write_csv_with_confidence - CSV with confidence column
✅ test_write_json_format - Basic JSON output format
✅ test_write_json_with_confidence - JSON with confidence field
✅ test_write_batch_results - Combined JSON+CSV output
✅ test_generate_summary_stats - Statistics generation

All 8 tests PASSING ✅
```

### 5. **State Management Updates**

Extended `InferenceState` to track confidence preference:
- state.py:35 - Added `batch_include_confidence` session key
- state.py:55 - Added field to dataclass
- state.py:86 - Added to `from_session()`
- state.py:106 - Added to `persist()`

---

## 🎨 **Preprocessing Integration Advantage**

**Major Finding:** Batch mode handles preprocessing **better** than single-image mode!

### Why Batch Mode is Superior for Preprocessing:

1. **File-based I/O**: Images read from disk, not uploaded buffers
   - Clean temp file creation at inference_runner.py:161
   - Proper cleanup in finally block

2. **Memory Efficient**: One image at a time
   - No accumulation of large image arrays
   - Perfect for heavy preprocessing operations

3. **Error Isolation**: Individual failures don't crash batch
   - Per-image try/catch at inference_runner.py:331-360
   - Failed images get empty polygons, batch continues

4. **Consistent with Training**: Uses same `DocumentPreprocessor`
   - Same preprocessing pipeline as training data
   - No upload/download format conversions

**User can safely enable preprocessing in batch mode!**

## 📊 Comparison: predict.py vs Streamlit Batch

| Feature | predict.py | Streamlit Batch | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| **Output Format** | Nested JSON | CSV/JSON (competition) | ✅ Different, but both valid |
| **Coordinates** | `remap_polygons()` | `remap_polygons()` | ✅ **IDENTICAL** |
| **EXIF Handling** | `normalize_pil_image()` | `normalize_pil_image()` | ✅ **IDENTICAL** |
| **Preprocessing** | Supported | Supported (better!) | ✅ Aligned |
| **Confidence Scores** | Optional | Optional | ✅ Aligned |
| **Batch Processing** | Yes | Yes | ✅ Both supported |

**Conclusion:** Outputs are **functionally equivalent** for competition submission!

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Format Fix Was Critical**: Using `image_name` instead of `filename` would have failed competition submission!

2. **Coordinate Alignment Was Already Done**: Previous work on EXIF orientation handling ensured both pipelines use the same transformation.

3. **Preprocessing Works Better in Batch Mode**: File-based processing avoids upload buffer issues that plagued single-image mode.

4. **Confidence Scores Are Easy**: Simple average of detection confidences provides useful quality metric.

5. **Pydantic Validation Rocks**: All input validation happens automatically, no manual checks needed!
