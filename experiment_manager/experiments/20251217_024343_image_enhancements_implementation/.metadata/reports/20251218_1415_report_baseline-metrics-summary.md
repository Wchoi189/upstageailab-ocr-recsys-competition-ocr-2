# Phase 1 Baseline Assessment Summary

**Date**: 2025-12-18
**Experiment**: 20251217_024343_image_enhancements_implementation
**Phase**: Week 1 Day 1 - Baseline Establishment
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Aggregate Metrics (n=6)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg Background Color Variance | 36.53 |
| Avg Color Cast Score | 58.06 |
| Avg Brightness (0-255) | 123.89 |
| Avg Contrast | 36.06 |
| Avg Estimated Skew | 14.98° |

## Issue Distribution

- **Significant Color Tint**: 6/6 (100%)
- **High Background Variation**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Text Skew Detected**: 2/6 (33%)
- **Low Contrast**: 1/6 (16%)

## Observations
The baseline assessment confirms that background color tint and variation are the most prevalent issues in the "worst performers" dataset. The high color cast score (58.06) justifies the priority on background normalization. Significant skew was detected in 33% of samples, with one extreme case (000732) showing -83° rotation.
