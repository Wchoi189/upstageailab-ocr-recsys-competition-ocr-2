# Enhancement Validation Report

**Image**: baskin_robbins_receipt_comparison.jpg
**Enhancement**: Background normalization, contrast adjustment, shadow reduction, slight deskew
**Verdict**: Significant

## Summary
- Key Wins: 
  1. Background color normalized to near-white (reduced yellow tint)
  2. Text contrast significantly improved (especially faded Korean characters)
  3. Shadow artifacts on left side reduced, improving OCR legibility
- Key Issues: 
  - Minor over-sharpening visible in barcode edges
  - Slight halo effect around receipt borders
- Recommendation: Deploy (with minor tuning to reduce halo artifacts)

## Metrics

| Dimension | Before | After | Δ | Success |
|-----------|--------|-------|---|---------|
| Tint Severity | 8 | 2 | -6 | ✅ |
| Slant Angle | ±1.5° | ±0.5° | -1.0° | ✅ |
| Contrast | 5 | 8 | +3 | ✅ |
| Shadows | 7 | 3 | -4 | ✅ |
| Noise | 6 | 4 | -2 | ✅ |
| Overall | 5 | 8 | +3 | ✅ |

## Detailed Observations

### 1. Background Improvement
- Color normalization: [Before RGB 210,180,100] → [After RGB 245,245,240]
- Tint severity: Before 8 → After 2 (dramatic reduction in yellow/orange cast)
- Uniformity: Before 6 → After 9 (background now consistently light gray/white)
- Success: Yes — achieved near-neutral white background; slight cool tone remains but doesn't interfere with text legibility

### 2. Text Alignment
- Slant angle: Before ±1.5° → After ±0.5° (receipt slightly tilted left in original, corrected)
- Alignment quality: Before 7 → After 9 (text lines now perfectly horizontal)
- Success: Yes — within ±0.5° of horizontal, well within the ±2° tolerance for OCR systems

### 3. Contrast Enhancement
- Text-background contrast: Before 5 → After 8 (black text much more distinct against light background)
- Faded text recovery: Yes — previously faint Korean characters (e.g., "매장취식", "스푼") now clearly legible
- Success: Yes — contrast ≥7 achieved across entire receipt, optimal for OCR processing

### 4. Shadow/Illumination
- Shadow severity: Before 7 → After 3 (strong shadow on left side almost eliminated)
- Illumination uniformity: Before 5 → After 8 (previously uneven lighting now balanced)
- Success: Yes — shadows reduced significantly without washing out text or creating new glare

### 5. Noise/Artifacts
- Noise level: Before 6 → After 4 (grain and texture reduced, especially in background)
- New artifacts: Minor halo around receipt edges, slight over-sharpening in barcode region
- Success: Yes — noise reduced substantially without compromising text integrity; artifacts are minimal and non-critical

### 6. Overall Quality
- Quality score: Before 5 → After 8 (significant visual and functional improvement)
- Readability: Before 6 → After 9 (all text, including small print and Korean characters, is now easily readable)
- Processing necessary: Yes — preprocessing was essential to recover faded text and eliminate shadows that would impair automated processing or human readability
