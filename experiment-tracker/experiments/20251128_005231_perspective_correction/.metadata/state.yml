current_state: ACTIVE
experiment_goal: Improve mask-only edge approximations beyond affine baseline
initial_assessment: Improve mask-only edge approximations beyond affine baseline
last_updated: 2025-11-28 03:25 (KST)
current_phase: Side-Based Regression
success_rate: 0% (0/25) with Strict Mode 10px epsilon.
improvement_status: Pivot to Line Regression. 10px epsilon strict fit failed (Over-Simplification vs Complexity). Moving to statistical reconstruction of edges.
key_achievements:
  - Forked experiment to preserve the stable LCC+approxPolyDP baseline separate from future tuning
  - Documented baseline heuristics (edge support coverage/ratio 0.90/0.80, RMSE <=2px, solidity, corner sharpness, parallelism) and logged per-edge metrics for every run
  - Quantified failure reasons across the 25 worst performers (edge_support/ratio/linearity each 21 occurrences) with percentile distributions for coverage/ratio
  - Confirmed robustness wins on selectstar_000155 and selectstar_000247, validating LCC filtering on outlier geometries
  - **RCA Completed**: Confirmed `approxPolyDP` simplification error (~27px) exceeded strict validation threshold (5px).
  - **Fail Fast**: "Epsilon Sensitivity Tuning" (Strict Mode 10px) failed to find *any* quad for 22/25 worst cases, confirming mask complexity requires regression, not reduction.
  - **Pivot**: Implemented "Side-Based Regression" (Smart Clustering) to bypass the noisy vertex count issue.
next_steps:
  - Implement `_fit_quadrilateral_regression` using `cv2.fitLine` on classified hull segments.
  - Run evaluation on 25 worst performers using regression.
known_issues:
  - Previous method (Polygon Reduction) is fundamentally limited by mask irregularity.
  - Expect regression to handle concavities better, but need to check for ghost lines if noise is asymmetric.
