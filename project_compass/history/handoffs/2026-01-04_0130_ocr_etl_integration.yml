phase_transition:
  from: "etl_implementation"
  to: "model_training"
  reason: "Validation dataset successfully converted to LMDB"

accomplishments:
  - title: "Integrated ocr-etl-pipeline"
    description: "Registered CLI commands (ocr_convert, ocr_inspect) in AGENTS.yaml and updated dataset registry."
    impact: "Standardized tool access via Project Compass."

  - title: "Defined ETL Schemas"
    description: "Created JSON schemas for ETL configuration and state management."
    impact: "Ensures type safety and robustness for future ETL jobs."

  - title: "Full Validation Dataset Conversion"
    description: "Converted 5,468 AI Hub files into a single 4.3GB LMDB file (616,366 samples)."
    impact: "Ready for high-performance training without file system clutter."

  - title: "No-Clutter Optimization"
    description: "Used LMDB to avoid creating millions of small files. Removed debug artifacts."
    impact: "Maintained clean workspace environment."
