# 2025-09-28 Documentation Refactor Complete

## Summary
Completed the major documentation refactor to establish a centralized, AI-agent-friendly knowledge base in `docs/ai_handbook/`.

## Changes Made

### **Documentation Structure**
- **New Structure:** Implemented the numbered hierarchy with `docs/ai_handbook/` as the single source of truth
- **Directories Created:**
  - `01_onboarding/` - Environment setup and data overview
  - `02_protocols/` - Step-by-step guides for recurring tasks
  - `03_references/` - Factual information about architecture and components
  - `04_experiments/` - Experiment logs and templates
  - `05_changelog/` - Project evolution tracking

### **Content Migration**
- **Migrated Existing Docs:** Consolidated content from old `docs/copilot/`, `docs/development/`, `docs/maintenance/` into the new structure
- **Archived Old Docs:** Moved original documentation to `DEPRECATED/docs/` to prevent confusion
- **Deprecated Planning Docs:** Removed `proposed structure.md` and `documentation-refactor_plan.md` (no longer needed)

### **AI Agent Integration**
- **New Instructions:** Replaced `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with comprehensive co-instructions pointing to the handbook
- **Command Registry:** Established framework for safe, autonomous script execution
- **Context Bundles:** Created task-specific document collections for efficient context loading

### **Tooling**
- **Agent Tools:** Created `scripts/agent_tools/summarize_run.py` for automated log summarization using LLM
- **Protocols Added:** 10 comprehensive protocols covering refactoring, debugging, context management, and Hydra configuration

## Impact
- **AI Agents:** Now have a clear entry point (`docs/ai_handbook/index.md`) with structured navigation
- **Consistency:** Eliminated redundant documentation and established single sources of truth
- **Maintainability:** Numbered hierarchy makes documentation easier to navigate and update
- **Automation:** Framework in place for context logging, checkpointing, and automated summarization

## Next Steps
- Update any remaining references to old documentation paths
- Begin using the new experiment logging template for future runs
- Implement the context logging protocols in agent workflows
