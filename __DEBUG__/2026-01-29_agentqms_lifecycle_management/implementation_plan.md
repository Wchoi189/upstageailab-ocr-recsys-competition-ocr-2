- **Risk 3:** Integration challenges with existing MCP
  - **Mitigation:** Close collaboration with MCP team

## Success Metrics
- **Metric 1:** Feature health scores available for 100% of components
- **Metric 2:** 50% reduction in unused/deprecated features
- **Metric 3:** <5% boundary violation rate
- **Metric 4:** 30% improvement in AI agent navigation efficiency
- **Metric 5:** 95% adoption of naming conventions

## Team Structure
- **Project Lead:** Overall coordination and governance
- **Health Monitoring Team:** Focus on health scoring and bloat detection
- **AI Agent Experience Team:** Focus on navigation and discovery
- **Process Team:** Focus on lifecycle workflows
- **Organization Team:** Focus on naming and structure

## Budget & Resources
- **Development Team:** 5 FTE for 12 weeks
- **Infrastructure:** Standard development environment
- **Testing Environment:** Dedicated staging environment
- **Monitoring Tools:** Existing dashboard infrastructure

## Dependencies
- **Dependency 1:** Existing MCP server architecture
- **Dependency 2:** Current AgentQMS registry system
- **Dependency 3:** Project Compass integration
- **Dependency 4:** Qwen client integration

## Rollback Plan
If critical issues arise, the system can be rolled back to the previous state by:
1. Disabling new lifecycle management features
2. Reverting to previous naming conventions
3. Restoring original boundary validation
4. Maintaining existing AI agent interfaces
