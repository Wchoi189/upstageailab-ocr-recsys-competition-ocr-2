current_state: PAUSED
experiment_goal: Improve mask-only edge approximations beyond affine baseline
initial_assessment: Improve mask-only edge approximations beyond affine baseline
last_updated: 2025-11-28 04:35 (KST)
current_phase: Session Handover
success_rate: 0% (0/25) with Dominant Edge Extension (Relaxed Validation).
improvement_status: Dominant Edge Extension failed due to Geometric Instability (Topology Trap & Lever Arm Effect). Pivot required to Angle-Based Bucketing.
key_achievements:
  - Forked experiment to preserve the stable LCC+approxPolyDP baseline separate from future tuning
  - Documented baseline heuristics and logged per-edge metrics
  - **RCA Completed**: Confirmed `approxPolyDP` simplification error (~27px) exceeded strict validation threshold.
  - **Fail Fast**: "Epsilon Sensitivity Tuning" (Strict Mode 10px) failed to find *any* quad for 22/25 worst cases.
  - **Fail Fast**: "Side-Based Regression" failed because it included outlier segments (folds/tears).
  - **Fail Fast**: "Dominant Edge Extension" failed (0/25) due to brittle segment counting and unstable extrapolation of short segments.
  - **Incident Report**: Generated `BUG-20251128-001` detailing the geometric instability.
next_steps:
  - Implement **Angle-Based Bucketing** in `mask_only_edge_detector.py`.
  - Classify *all* hull segments into 4 bins (Top/Bottom/Left/Right) based on 45-degree quadrants.
  - Regress a consensus line for each bin.
  - Intersect consensus lines to guarantee a quadrilateral.
known_issues:
  - Extrapolation of short/noisy segments is mathematically unstable.
  - `approxPolyDP` segment count is uncontrollable on organic shapes.
