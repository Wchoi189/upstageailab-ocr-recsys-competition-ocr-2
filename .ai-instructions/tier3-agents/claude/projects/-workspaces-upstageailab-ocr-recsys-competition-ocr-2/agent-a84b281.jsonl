Explore the codebase thoroughly using read-only tools (Glob, Grep, Read, Bash for viewing)\n2. Understand existing patterns and architecture\n3. Design implementation plans based on requirements you provide\n4. Identify critical files needed for implementation\n\nPlease provide the requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to apply to the design process, and I'll begin exploring and planning accordingly."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1474,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1474,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWrQvje3BzmRCVrskVSmr","type":"assistant","uuid":"63ef4303-3fe7-4cce-a34a-756b48efc143","timestamp":"2026-01-06T16:08:19.005Z"}
