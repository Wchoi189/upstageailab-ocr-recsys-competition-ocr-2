# AgentQMS Framework Constitution

## Preamble
This constitution establishes the foundational principles and governance structure for the AgentQMS framework lifecycle management system. It defines the core values, organizational structure, and decision-making processes that will guide the evolution of the framework toward greater sustainability, maintainability, and AI agent accessibility.

## Article I: Core Principles

### Section 1.1: Sustainability First
The framework shall prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term feature additions. Every new feature must include provisions for its eventual lifecycle management, including monitoring, maintenance, and retirement.

### Section 1.2: Boundary Integrity
Clear architectural boundaries must be maintained between system tiers. Cross-tier contamination is prohibited without explicit governance approval and documented justification.

### Section 1.3: Prune Over Grow
When faced with the choice between adding new features and optimizing existing ones, the framework shall prioritize optimization and removal of unused/deprecated elements.

### Section 1.4: AI-Agent Centric Design
All framework improvements must consider the needs of AI agents as primary users, ensuring clear navigation, discoverability, and contextual relevance.

## Article II: Organizational Structure

### Section 2.1: Lifecycle Governance Board
A governing body responsible for:
- Approving new feature additions
- Authorizing feature deprecation and retirement
- Maintaining boundary integrity
- Reviewing health metrics and usage patterns

### Section 2.2: Tier Custodians
Each tier (SST, Framework, Agents, Workflows) shall have designated custodians responsible for:
- Maintaining component health within their tier
- Ensuring boundary compliance
- Coordinating cross-tier dependencies

### Section 2.3: AI Agent Liaisons
Representatives who ensure AI agent needs are considered in all framework decisions and who maintain the AI agent navigation pathways.

## Article III: Decision-Making Process

### Section 3.1: Feature Addition Protocol
New features require:
1. Health score projection
2. Boundary impact assessment
3. Maintenance commitment
4. Retirement plan

### Section 3.2: Deprecation Authority
Features may be marked for deprecation based on:
1. Usage metrics falling below threshold
2. Boundary violation detection
3. Maintenance burden exceeding value
4. Governance board recommendation

### Section 3.3: Emergency Pruning
Features may be immediately retired if they:
1. Create security vulnerabilities
2. Severely impact system stability
3. Violate architectural boundaries
4. Are superseded by superior alternatives

## Article IV: Measurement and Accountability

### Section 4.1: Health Metrics
All framework components must maintain:
- Usage frequency tracking
- Performance impact measurement
- Maintenance effort quantification
- Boundary compliance scoring

### Section 4.2: Transparency Requirements
Framework health must be publicly visible through:
- Real-time health dashboards
- Quarterly audit reports
- Annual framework evolution summaries
- AI agent usability metrics

## Article V: Amendment Process
This constitution may be amended through:
1. Proposal by any tier custodian
2. Review by Lifecycle Governance Board
3. Approval by 2/3 majority of all stakeholders
4. Implementation with 30-day transition period

## Article VI: Effective Date
This constitution becomes effective immediately upon adoption and supersedes all previous governance documents.
