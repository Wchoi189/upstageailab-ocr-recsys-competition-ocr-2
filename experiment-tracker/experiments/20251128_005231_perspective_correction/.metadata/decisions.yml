  decision: Fork new experiment to preserve LCC + heuristics baseline before further tuning
  rationale: Separate refinement work from the stabilized mask-only baseline to avoid regressions and keep rollback artifacts intact.
  impact: Baseline configuration, metrics, and scripts are frozen under @20251122_172313 while this experiment iterates on edge approximation quality.
  timestamp: 2025-11-28 00:52 (KST)
  alternatives_considered:
    - Continue iterating inside original experiment
    - Branch code without tracker context

- id: dec_002
  decision: Treat LCC-filtered approxPolyDP quadrilateral fitting as the new reference geometry pipeline
  rationale: Trapezoid fits respect projective foreshortening and eliminate virtual corners introduced by minAreaRect while still working purely on mask data.
  impact: All subsequent tuning (snapping, threshold sweeps) will build on the approxPolyDP output; heuristics now gate trapezoids rather than affine rectangles.
  timestamp: 2025-11-28 01:00 (KST)
  alternatives_considered:
    - Relax minAreaRect heuristics
    - Hybrid minAreaRect + hull blending without LCC filtering
