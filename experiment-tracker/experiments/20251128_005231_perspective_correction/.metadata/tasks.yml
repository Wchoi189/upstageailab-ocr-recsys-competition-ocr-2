  description: Establish approxPolyDP trapezoid baseline with LCC filtering
  status: completed
  created_at: '2025-11-28 00:52 (KST)'
  completed_at: '2025-11-28 01:00 (KST)'
  notes: Ported mask-only fitter away from minAreaRect to LCC+approxPolyDP trapezoids and preserved the configuration as the new baseline for future iterations.

  description: Analyze edge-support and linearity failures on 25-case suite
  status: completed
  created_at: '2025-11-28 01:05 (KST)'
  completed_at: '2025-11-28 01:20 (KST)'
  notes: Parsed test_results.json to quantify failure reasons (edge_support/ratio/linearity 21x each) and percentile ranges for support/coverage metrics.

  description: Prototype snapping and threshold tuning for low-support edges
  status: in_progress
  created_at: '2025-11-28 01:25 (KST)'
  notes: Exploring adaptive snapping toward local edge-density clusters plus relaxed thresholds to recover borderline fits without reintroducing ghost lines.

- id: task_004
  description: Validate tuned heuristics on 25/50/200 image cohorts
  status: pending
  created_at: '2025-11-28 01:25 (KST)'
  notes: Re-run worst-performer, extended, and 200-image suites once snapping/threshold strategy stabilizes; compare mask/bbox retention vs. area ratio outcomes.
