# AgentQMS: AI-Native Architecture (Registry-Driven)

## Core Rules
- Registry is the single source of truth: resolve standards via registry.yaml.
- One file = one function (specs | constraints | discovery | runtime).
- Tier intent: SST (laws), Framework (capabilities), Agents (identity), Workflows (execution).
- Any move/split requires registry sync.

## Classification Shortcuts
- Framework = HOW it works (protocols, contracts, infra).
- Agents = WHO it is (identity/persona).
- Workflows = DO steps (runbooks, scripts).

## Actions
- Query registry before edits.
- Load only required standards.
- Split rules vs steps.
