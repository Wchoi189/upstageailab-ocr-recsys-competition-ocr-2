experiment_goal: Implement angle-based bucketing for dominant edge fitting
initial_assessment: Implement angle-based bucketing for dominant edge fitting
last_updated: 2025-11-29 02:18 (KST)
current_phase: Experiment Complete - 100% Success Achieved
success_rate: 100% (25/25) - All samples pass with geometric synthesis
improvement_status: Experiment successfully completed. Achieved 100% success rate through geometric synthesis approach that eliminates validation paradox. All critical bugs resolved.
key_achievements:
  - Implemented angle-based bucketing with horizontal/vertical classification (abs(dx) > abs(dy))
  - Created diagnostic visualization tool for bin assignment inspection
  - Fixed coordinate inversion bug (Top/Bottom swapped in image coordinates)
  - Implemented geometric synthesis approach (intersection of fitted_quad and bbox_corners)
  - Fixed variable shadowing bug (canvas dimensions incorrect)
  - Achieved 100% success rate (25/25) on worst performers
  - Eliminated validation paradox by trusting regression results and using geometric clipping
next_steps:
  - Ready for integration into main codebase
  - Consider performance optimization if needed
  - Document geometric synthesis approach for future reference
known_issues:
  - None - all issues resolved
