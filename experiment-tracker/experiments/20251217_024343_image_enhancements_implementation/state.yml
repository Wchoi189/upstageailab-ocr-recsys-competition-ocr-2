decisions:
- date: '2025-12-18'
  decision: Prioritize background normalization over shadow removal based on 100%
    prevalence in test set
  rationale: 'All 6 test images show severe background tint (avg score: 58.1) and
    variation (avg: 36.5)'
- date: '2025-12-18'
  decision: Restructured experiment to comply with EDS v1.0
  rationale: Improved traceability and consistency with experiment-tracker standards
- date: '2025-12-18'
  decision: Selected gray-world method for background normalization
  rationale: Achieves 75% tint reduction, 100% target achievement (6/6 images <20),
    fastest processing (62.6ms)
- date: '2025-12-18'
  decision: Rejected edge-based method
  rationale: Fails to meet tint target on any image, slower processing, no advantages
- date: '2025-12-18'
  decision: Approved gray-world background normalization for pipeline integration
  rationale: Achieves 75% tint reduction, 100% target achievement, 4.65/5 validation
    score. Trade-offs acceptable.
- date: '2025-12-18'
  decision: Selected Hough lines method for text deskewing
  rationale: 2.87° avg angle (83% success), 38.77ms processing, handles extreme skews
    (±15° → ±0° per VLM)
- date: '2025-12-18'
  decision: Rejected projection profile and combined methods for deskewing
  rationale: Projection failed at -45° boundary on all images. Combined inherited
    failure. Hough lines superior.
- date: '2025-12-18'
  decision: Approved Hough lines deskewing for pipeline integration
  rationale: 4.5/5 quantitative + 4.5/5 VLM = 4.6/5 combined. VLM confirmed perfect
    horizontal alignment on extreme cases.

insights:
- date: '2025-12-18'
  impact: VLM detected perfect alignment (±15° → ±0°) that quantitative missed, plus
    identified sharpening artifacts
  insight: VLM validation with Dashscope/Qwen3 VL Plus provides critical visual confirmation
- date: '2025-12-18'
  impact: Tuning should focus on gray-world sharpening parameters. Deskewing does
    not introduce artifacts.
  insight: Sharpening artifacts originate from gray-world method, not deskewing
- date: '2025-12-18'
  impact: VLM analysis on deskewing results showed background norm effects too, validating
    pipeline integration approach
  insight: Combined preprocessing (background norm + deskewing) compounds benefits
- date: '2025-12-18'
  impact: High confidence in both validation methods. Future experiments can use either
    or both as needed.
  insight: VLM and quantitative metrics have 96-100% correlation on quality scores
- date: '2025-12-18'
  impact: Validates Week 1 focus on background normalization before other enhancements
  insight: Background color tint and variation are universal issues (100% prevalence)
- date: '2025-12-18'
  impact: Week 2 deskewing implementation must handle extreme angles
  insight: One image (000732) has extreme -83° rotation requiring robust deskewing
