## 🚨 Current Situation

**Status**: 🔴 **CRITICAL - App Completely Broken**

### Issues:
1. App freezes indefinitely (infinite loading spinner)
2. Dropdown selections cause permanent freeze
3. Preprocessed images blur text (illegible quality)
4. Only works with ALL preprocessing disabled

### Root Causes:
- Infinite rerun loop (dict comparison bug)
- Resource leaks (excessive image copying)
- No caching (reprocesses on every interaction)
- Aggressive algorithms (destroy text quality)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### TODAY (40 minutes):
1. Read: [Emergency Fixes](preprocessing_viewer_emergency_fixes.md)
2. Apply: All 4 emergency fixes
3. Test: Verify app no longer freezes
4. Result: Minimal ly functional app

### THIS WEEK (2 hours):
1. Read: [Redesign Summary](preprocessing_viewer_redesign_summary.md)
2. Evaluate: Options A, B, C, D
3. Decide: Timeline, resources, requirements
4. Communicate: Share decision with team

### NEXT 2-4 WEEKS (part-time):
1. Read: [Refactor Plan](preprocessing_viewer_refactor_plan.md)
2. Execute: Chosen refactor approach
3. Test: Performance and quality benchmarks
4. Deploy: Production-ready system

## 📊 Decision Matrix

| Approach | Timeline | Outcome | Best For |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|
| **A: Emergency Only** | 1 day | Minimal function | Demos, temporary use |
| **B: Incremental Refactor** | 2-3 weeks | Production ready | Balanced approach |
| **C: Complete Rewrite** | 4-5 weeks | Clean architecture | Long-term product |
| **D: External Tool** | 1 week | Battle-tested | Fast time-to-market |

**Recommended**: **Apply A today**, then **choose B or C** for production system.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

### What Went Wrong:
1. **No architecture planning** → Monolithic 700-line files
2. **No performance testing** → RBF complexity explosion undetected
3. **No caching strategy** → Constant reprocessing
4. **Aggressive defaults** → Text quality destroyed

### What We Learned:
1. **Modular design is critical** for debuggability
2. **Caching is mandatory** for interactive UIs
3. **Test with production data** (large images)
4. **Text preservation requires special care** in preprocessing

### What's Next:
1. **Apply emergency fixes** (restore function)
2. **Choose refactor approach** (based on timeline)
3. **Execute refactor plan** (modular architecture)
4. **Establish performance benchmarks** (prevent regression)

## 📞 Need Help?

If you're unsure which approach to choose:

1. **Timeline-driven**:
   - Need it this week? → Option D (External Tool)
   - Need it in 2-3 weeks? → Option B (Incremental)
   - Have 4+ weeks? → Option C (Full Rewrite)

2. **Requirements-driven**:
   - Standard preprocessing OK? → Option D
   - Need custom algorithms? → Option B or C

3. **Resource-driven**:
   - Minimal dev time? → Option D
   - Part-time? → Option B
   - Full-time? → Option C

**Still unsure?** Default to: **Emergency fixes today + Option B (Incremental Refactor)**

**Bottom Line**: The app is broken and requires immediate emergency fixes followed by a proper refactor. Start with [Emergency Fixes](preprocessing_viewer_emergency_fixes.md), then choose your refactor approach using [Redesign Summary](preprocessing_viewer_redesign_summary.md).
